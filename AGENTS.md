# Testing (Playwright)

`e2e/smoke.spec.ts` visits every public page unconditionally, plus `/dashboard` while
authenticated if `E2E_TEST_EMAIL`/`E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` are set (skips cleanly otherwise —
see `e2e/login.ts`). It fails on any thrown render error or the app's own error boundary.
It exists to catch bugs `next build`'s type check can't — specifically Server Component ->
Client Component prop violations (e.g. passing a non-serializable value as a prop), which
only surface once React actually renders the page. Runs in CI on every push to `main`
(`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).

When you add a new page under `src/app`: add its path to `PUBLIC_PAGES` in
`e2e/smoke.spec.ts` (or a new authenticated test, if it needs a session) — this repo has no
central page registry to read from automatically, unlike some of this author's other repos.

When you add a new Client Component that receives props from a Server Component, or
otherwise touches the server/client boundary in a new way: run `npm run test:e2e` locally
before pushing, not just `npm run build`. The build passing is not sufficient evidence the
page still renders — that's exactly the gap this suite exists to close.

Needs `E2E_TEST_EMAIL`/`E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` in `.env.local` (a dedicated test account, not
your own) to exercise the authenticated `/dashboard` test locally; without them it's
skipped, not failed.

# Git workflow

Solo-maintained repo — push commits directly to `main`, no feature branches or PRs needed.
This holds even if a session is scaffolded (e.g. by Claude Code on the web) with a
designated `claude/...` working branch — the branch isn't something you can avoid
creating (the launcher sets it up before you get control), so finish the work there,
push/fast-forward straight to `main` instead of leaving it on the feature branch or
opening a PR, then delete the now-redundant `claude/...` branch from the remote.

Before starting any work, check `git branch --show-current` — if it's not `main`, that's
a leftover/scaffolded branch, not intentional work to build on top of. Switch to `main`
and `git pull` to get the latest before making changes, then commit/push straight to
`main` when done (per above).

# Never start the dev server

Do not run `npm run dev` (or any equivalent) yourself, including via the Browser pane's
preview tools. Rely on `npm run build`/`next build`'s type check and `npm run test:e2e`
(see above) to verify changes instead. If a change genuinely needs eyes-on browser
verification, ask the user to run the dev server and check it themselves.

# Single-shell app screens

The authenticated area (`src/app/(app)`) is one shell, not one page per route. The layout
checks the session and server-renders every screen once (`src/components/screens/*`), then
passes them to `AppShell` via its `screens` prop, keyed by path. Nav clicks call
`history.pushState` so switching screens never hits the server; `/dashboard` and
`/settings` still exist as real URLs (refresh, deep links, back button) but their
`page.tsx` files render `null`.

When you add an authenticated screen: add a component under `src/components/screens`, add it
to `screens` in `(app)/layout.tsx`, add its link to `navLinks` and its title to `TITLES`
in `app-shell.tsx`, keep a `page.tsx` (with `metadata`) at the route, and add the path to
`e2e/smoke.spec.ts`. Auth pages (`/auth/*`) and `/` stay ordinary routes.
